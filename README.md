This report investigates the momentum effect in the S&P 500 index through a series of systematic backtests. The goal is to analyze whether portfolios formed by selecting top-performing stocks based on past returns can outperform the broader market. Using historical data from the past 20 years, I constructed and evaluated multiple portfolio configurations across different rebalancing intervals and stock counts.
